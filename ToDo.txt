High Priority:

- Options for "UE4 DDS Tools"

- Insensitive PNG Paths

- Automatic detection of PNG Files in a Input Folder as alternative to Paths.
  Listing and choosing from a menu during Inject

Medium Priority:

- Bugs :hidethepain:

- Backup Tool

- Automatic Path detection of Game Files

- Automatic Import & Exporting

- Better Documentation

- Solid Error Reports, both read- and understandable by the lowly commoners.

Low Priority:

- Testing and adding official support for all Filetypes currently "supported" by "UE4 DDS Tools"

	- Tested working

	 - PNG

	- Tested broken
	
	 - DDS (Injection Fails)

	- Untested
	
	 - bmp
	 - jpg
	 - hdr
	 - tga

- Add menu entry for explaining the benefits and downsides of different image file types

- Clean up visual inconsistencies

- Automatic Detection of Shirt Uassets, ignore list for unused

- Support for other Cosmetics


Eventually:

- Replacing repak with something that supports OODLE

- Re-Writing in likely Python, unlikely JS or Rust

- Linux Support because Windows just bad
